			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to my corner of the digital universe! I'm Adrian, a budding web developer fueled by curiosity 
				and a passion for crafting engaging online experiences. As a web developer, I'm eagerly exploring the 
				vast landscapes of code, design principles, and user experience. With a foundation in 
				<strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>
				, I'm constantly honing my skills and embracing new technologies to bring ideas to life. Every project is an 
				opportunity to learn, grow, and refine my craft, whether it's building responsive layouts, troubleshooting 
				bugs, or experimenting with emerging trends. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous improvement, 
				and I'm excited to embark on this journey of innovation and discovery.
